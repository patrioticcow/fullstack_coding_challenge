For this challenge i used
 -- Ionic Framework
 -- AngularJS
 -- HammerJs
 
the files i worked on are:
 -- www/templates/tab-dash.html
 -- www/js/controllers.js
 -- www/services.js
 
How to run:
 -- run "npm install -g cordova ionic"
 -- go into the base dir and run "ionic serve"
 -- best experience on latest Chrome
 
Notes:
 Because of the size of the code i wrote i left everything in the controllers.js
 I tried to leave plenty comments
 I tried to implement a gamepad, but the browser support is very bad, though it can be done.
 
Total time:
 This challange took me about 6 hours to write and test.
 
Features:
 It's a match!
 Should be responsive as far as the demo that i created goes.
 I added match percentages, i think that's a cool feature to gave, but it needs more thought put into it.
 Another feature i added is the "Send Gift" section.
 
If i had more time i would:
 -- test it some more
 -- maybe change the logic on how data is manipulated to be grabbed from the server and displayed
 -- performance improvements
